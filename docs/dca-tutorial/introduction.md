# Introduction to Dollar Cost Averaging with Vincent

## What is Dollar Cost Averaging?

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price. This approach reduces the impact of volatility on your overall investment and eliminates the need to time the market.

## Why Build a DCA Agent?

Building a DCA agent with Vincent offers several advantages:

1. **Automation**: Once set up, your agent will handle purchases automatically without requiring manual intervention.
2. **Consistency**: The agent ensures you stick to your investment schedule, removing emotional decision-making.
3. **Security**: Vincent's secure agent wallet system ensures your funds are only used as explicitly permitted.
4. **Flexibility**: You can customize parameters like investment amount, frequency, and target assets.
