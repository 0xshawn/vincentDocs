# Deploying Your DCA Agent

In this final section, we'll cover how to deploy your Dollar Cost Averaging agent to production. We'll discuss different deployment options, security considerations, and best practices for running your agent reliably.

## Preparing for Production

Before deploying to production, make sure to:

1. **Update Configuration**: Switch from testnet to mainnet in your `.env` file
2. **Register with Vincent**: Complete the app registration process with Vincent
3. **Create Production Roles**: Define your roles and tools for the production environment
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for your agent
5. **Secure Your Keys**: Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured

## Building for Production

Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript for production:

```bash
# Add a build script to package.json
# "build": "tsc"

# Then run
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled JavaScript files.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Server Deployment

Deploy your agent on a dedicated server or VPS:

1. **Set Up a Server**: Use a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean
2. **Install Dependencies**: Set up Node.js and install required packages
3. **Configure Environment**: Set up environment variables securely
4. **Use a Process Manager**: Deploy with PM2 to ensure your agent stays running

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start your agent with PM2
pm2 start dist/index.js --name dca-agent

# Set up PM2 to start on system boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Option 2: Serverless Deployment

For a serverless approach, you can split your agent into two components:

1. **Scheduler**: A scheduled function that triggers at your DCA frequency
2. **Executor**: A function that executes the DCA purchase

This can be implemented using:
- AWS Lambda with EventBridge for scheduling
- Google Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler
- Azure Functions with Timer triggers

Example AWS Lambda implementation:

```javascript
// lambda-handler.js
const { executeDCA } = require('./dist/dca');
const { initializeVincent } = require('./dist/vincent');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    console.log('DCA Lambda triggered');
    
    // Initialize Vincent wallet
    const wallet = await initializeVincent();
    
    // Get parameters from environment or event
    const tokenAddress = process.env.DCA_TOKEN_ADDRESS;
    const ethAmount = process.env.DCA_AMOUNT;
    
    // Execute DCA purchase
    await executeDCA(
      wallet,
      tokenAddress,
      ethers.utils.parseEther(ethAmount)
    );
    
    return { statusCode: 200, body: 'DCA purchase executed successfully' };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing DCA purchase:', error);
    return { statusCode: 500, body: 'Error executing DCA purchase' };
  }
};
```

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

Create a Docker container for your agent:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY dist/ ./dist/

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t dca-agent .
docker run -d --name dca-agent --restart always --env-file .env dca-agent
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Environment Variables

Never hardcode sensitive information. Use environment variables and secure them properly:

- For server deployments, use a `.env` file that's not checked into version control
- For cloud deployments, use the provider's secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, etc.)
- Consider using a vault service like HashiCorp Vault for advanced security

### Error Handling and Recovery

Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms:

```typescript
// In your agent's executePurchase method
async executePurchase() {
  try {
    // Attempt the purchase
    await executeDCA(
      this.vincentWallet,
      this.tokenAddress,
      ethers.utils.parseEther(this.amount.toString())
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing DCA purchase:', error);
    
    // Log the error to your monitoring system
    await this.logError(error);
    
    // Implement retry logic with backoff
    if (this.retryCount < this.maxRetries) {
      this.retryCount++;
      const backoffTime = Math.pow(2, this.retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      
      console.log(`Retrying in ${backoffTime / 1000} seconds (attempt ${this.retryCount}/${this.maxRetries})`);
      
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.executePurchase();
      }, backoffTime);
    } else {
      // Alert on repeated failures
      await this.sendAlert('DCA purchase failed after maximum retries');
      this.retryCount = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

Set up monitoring and alerting to detect issues:

- Use a service like Datadog, New Relic, or Sentry for monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed purchases, low balances, or unexpected errors
- Implement health checks that verify your agent is running correctly

## Scaling Your DCA Agent

As your user base grows, consider these scaling strategies:

### Multi-User Support

Modify your agent to support multiple users:

```typescript
// Example multi-user agent structure
class DCAAgentManager {
  private agents: Map<string, DCAAgent> = new Map();
  
  async addUser(userId: string, config: DCAConfig) {
    // Initialize agent for user
    const agent = await new DCAAgent(
      config.frequency,
      config.tokenAddress,
      config.amount
    ).initialize(userId);
    
    // Store agent
    this.agents.set(userId, agent);
    
    // Start agent
    agent.start();
    
    return agent;
  }
  
  removeUser(userId: string) {
    const agent = this.agents.get(userId);
    if (agent) {
      agent.stop();
      this.agents.delete(userId);
    }
  }
  
  // Other management methods...
}
```

### Database Integration

Store user configurations and purchase history in a database:

- Use MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Use PostgreSQL for relational data with complex queries
- Consider using a managed database service for reduced maintenance

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a secure Dollar Cost Averaging agent using Vincent's agent wallet system. Your agent can now execute regular purchases on behalf of users while ensuring their funds are only used as explicitly permitted.

As you continue to develop your agent, consider:

- Adding more features like performance tracking and reporting
- Supporting additional DEXes and tokens
- Implementing more advanced DCA strategies

Remember that security should always be your top priority when dealing with user funds. Vincent's permission system helps ensure that your agent can only perform the specific actions that users have approved.

Happy building!
